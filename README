The strategy of Clever player:
This player tries to fill the first two rows on the board, each row, from left to right. 
When these rows are full, he randomly chooses a slot to fill from the remaining rows, 
if this slot is free - fills, if not - guesses again.

The strategy of Genius player:
This player tries to fill the entire board, row by row from left to right. 
He tries to fill the leftmost slot in the first row, if it is free - fills, 
otherwise - moves to the right, and so on.

The advantages of the software design where each of the player classes implements a common interface are:
-Prevention of code duplication.
-Generalize the players - the interface is the common denominator between the player classes.
-We can replace the implementation and the customer programming for the interface will not have to change their code.
